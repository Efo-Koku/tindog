Tindog - (a Tinder for dogs) is a web application that connects dogs. It's a really fun version of the popular dating app Tinder and the name "Tindog" is a portmanteau of Tinder/Dog. 
I created this project as part of my Web Development BootCamp course on Udemy. 
I used jQuery, Bootstrap along with HTML and CSS to complete the project.
